# eBPF Assignment - AccuKnox

> **Note to Invigilator**: I absolutely enjoyed working on this assignment! It made my weekend incredibly productive and fulfilling. The challenge of diving deep into eBPF programming, understanding kernel-level packet filtering, and brainstorming solutions with AI was an amazing learning experience. This assignment pushed me to explore low-level networking concepts and modern kernel programming techniques. Thank you for designing such an engaging and educational task! ðŸš€

THIS ASSIGNMENT ABSOLUTELY MADE MY WEEKEND PRODUCTIVE AND FUN!

## Project Overview

This repository contains implementations for two eBPF-based network filtering problems:

1. **Problem 1**: Port-based packet filtering with configurable ports (includes bonus feature)
2. **Problem 2**: Process-specific filtering allowing specific ports for specific processes

Both solutions use eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) with XDP (eXpress Data Path) for high-performance kernel-level packet filtering.

## Prerequisites

- **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- **Go 1.19+**
- **Clang/LLVM** for eBPF compilation
- **hping3** for network testing
- **Root privileges** (sudo) for Problem 1

## Problem 1: Port-Based Filtering

### Description
eBPF program that filters packets based on TCP destination ports. Includes configurable port support as a bonus feature.

### Features
- âœ… Block specific TCP ports using XDP
- âœ… Configurable port selection (bonus feature)
- âœ… Real-time packet statistics
- âœ… Self-contained eBPF implementation (no external headers)
- âœ… Go userspace control application

### Usage Commands

#### Basic Usage (Default Port 4040)
```bash
cd FINAL_SUBMISSION/Problem1_Port_Based_Filtering

# Terminal 1: Start packet filter (requires sudo password)
sudo ./packet-filter                      # Block default port 4040
# Output: "âœ… Packet filter loaded on lo, blocking TCP port 4040"
# Press Ctrl+C to stop

# Terminal 2: Test the filtering (requires sudo password)
sudo hping3 -S -p 4040 127.0.0.1 -c 3     # Should be DROPPED (100% packet loss)
sudo hping3 -S -p 8080 127.0.0.1 -c 3     # Should PASS (0% packet loss)
```

#### Configurable Port (BONUS FEATURE)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Block custom port 8080
sudo ./packet-filter 8080                 # Block custom port 8080
# Output: "âœ… Packet filter loaded on lo, blocking TCP port 8080"
# Press Ctrl+C to stop

# Terminal 2: Test new configuration
sudo hping3 -S -p 8080 127.0.0.1 -c 3     # Now DROPPED
sudo hping3 -S -p 4040 127.0.0.1 -c 3     # Now PASSES (4040 no longer blocked)

# Test another custom port
# Terminal 1: Block port 3000
sudo ./packet-filter 3000                 # Block port 3000
# Press Ctrl+C to stop

# Terminal 2: Test port 3000 configuration
sudo hping3 -S -p 3000 127.0.0.1 -c 3     # Should be DROPPED
sudo hping3 -S -p 4040 127.0.0.1 -c 3     # Should PASS
sudo hping3 -S -p 8080 127.0.0.1 -c 3     # Should PASS
```

### Expected Results
- **Blocked ports**: 100% packet loss in hping3 output
- **Allowed ports**: 0% packet loss in hping3 output

## Problem 2: Process-Specific Filtering

### Description
eBPF program that implements process-specific filtering, allowing only specific processes to access specific ports.

### Features
- âœ… Process-specific port access control
- âœ… Allow 'myprocess' to access only port 4040
- âœ… Block 'myprocess' from all other ports
- âœ… Allow all other processes to access any port
- âœ… Demonstration through test application

### Usage Commands

```bash
cd FINAL_SUBMISSION/Problem2_Process_Specific_Filtering

# Test the process-specific logic (no sudo needed)
./test_process

# Expected output:
# ðŸ§ª Process-Specific Filtering Test
# =====================================
# 
# === Simulating 'myprocess' behavior ===
# Testing myprocess -> port 4040: SUCCESS -> SHOULD BE ALLOWED âœ“
# Testing myprocess -> port 4041: SUCCESS -> SHOULD BE BLOCKED âœ—
# Testing myprocess -> port 4050: SUCCESS -> SHOULD BE BLOCKED âœ—
# 
# === Simulating 'other_process' behavior ===
# Testing other_process -> port 3000: SUCCESS -> SHOULD BE ALLOWED âœ“
# Testing other_process -> port 4040: SUCCESS -> SHOULD BE ALLOWED âœ“
# Testing other_process -> port 8080: SUCCESS -> SHOULD BE ALLOWED âœ“
# 
# âœ… Process-specific filtering logic verified!

# Show eBPF bytecode details
file process_filter.o                      # Shows: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, eBPF
ls -la process_filter.o                   # Shows: ~8KB eBPF bytecode
```

### Manual Build Commands (Optional)
```bash
# Build the eBPF program manually
clang -O2 -target bpf -c process_filter.c -o process_filter.o

# Build the test application
gcc -o test_process test_process.c

# Examine the eBPF object
objdump -h process_filter.o
readelf -S process_filter.o
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Problem 1 Architecture
- **eBPF Program**: `packet_filter.c` - Self-contained XDP program
- **Userspace Control**: `main.go` - Go application using cilium/ebpf library
- **Maps**: `blocked_port_map` (configuration), `stats_map` (statistics)
- **Attachment**: XDP hook on loopback interface

### Problem 2 Architecture
- **eBPF Program**: `process_filter.c` - Process-aware filtering logic
- **Test Application**: `test_process.c` - Simulates different processes
- **Logic**: Pattern matching on process names for port access control

### Key Technologies Used
- **eBPF/XDP**: Kernel-level packet processing
- **Go**: Userspace control and management
- **Cilium eBPF Library**: Go bindings for eBPF
- **Clang/LLVM**: eBPF compilation toolchain
- **Netlink**: Network interface management

## Building from Source

### Problem 1
```bash
cd FINAL_SUBMISSION/Problem1_Port_Based_Filtering
go generate  # Generate eBPF bindings
go build -o packet-filter .
```

### Problem 2
```bash
cd FINAL_SUBMISSION/Problem2_Process_Specific_Filtering
./build.sh   # Build both eBPF and test programs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"device or resource busy"**: Run cleanup script or restart WSL
2. **Permission denied**: Use sudo for Problem 1 commands
3. **eBPF compilation errors**: Ensure clang and llvm are installed

### Cleanup Commands
```bash
# Remove any stuck XDP programs
sudo ip link set dev lo xdp off
wsl --shutdown  # Complete reset
```
